The dataset's owner Kaggle is the source providing the data.


## Terrorism Analysis
* Load the Raw Data.
* Data cleaning is performed on Python libraries Numpy, and pandas.
* Made sure data is Dropping unnecessary columns, Dropping duplicate rows, and Cleaning individual rows.
* Cleaned the data, and it is ready for developing the Interactive Dashboard.
